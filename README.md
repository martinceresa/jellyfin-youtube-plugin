# YouTubeSync – Jellyfin Plugin

Watch YouTube channels and playlists directly in Jellyfin — no downloading required.

The plugin syncs metadata and artwork from YouTube into your library and streams videos on demand using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## Installation

Add the plugin repository in Jellyfin under **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → +** :

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingschnulli/jellyfin-youtube-plugin/main/manifest.json
```

Then install **YouTubeSync** from the plugin catalogue and restart Jellyfin.

### Requirements

- **Jellyfin 12.1** or later (the plugin runs on .NET 10). Servers still on Jellyfin 10.11 are offered the last 0.1.x release from the same plugin repository.
- **yt-dlp** available on PATH (or configured in plugin settings)
- **ffmpeg** (only needed for Enhanced playback mode)

## Getting started

1. Open **Dashboard → Plugins → YouTubeSync → Settings**.
2. Set the **Library folder** to a path inside one of your Jellyfin libraries (e.g. `/media/youtube`).
3. Set the **Jellyfin address** to the URL your playback devices use to reach the server.
4. Click **+ Add Channel or Playlist**, paste a YouTube URL, give it a name, and save.
5. The sync task runs automatically every 6 hours. You can also trigger it manually from **Dashboard → Scheduled Tasks**.

After sync, your YouTube content appears in Jellyfin organised by channel, season (year), and episode — complete with artwork and metadata.

## Playback modes

| Mode | What it does | Needs ffmpeg? |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple** (default) | Hands Jellyfin a direct YouTube stream URL. Lightweight and easy. | No |
| **Enhanced** | Re-streams through a local ffmpeg process for more consistent quality. Falls back to Simple automatically if anything goes wrong. | Yes |

You can switch between modes in the plugin settings at any time.

## Known limitations

- Simple mode may cap at 720p to keep playback stable across different clients.
- Enhanced mode currently outputs a single 1080p HLS profile.
- Age-restricted or members-only videos will not play (no cookie support yet).

## Build from source

Requires the .NET 10 SDK.

```bash
dotnet publish Jellyfin.Plugin.YouTubeSync/Jellyfin.Plugin.YouTubeSync.csproj \
  -c Release --no-self-contained -o publish/
```

Copy the resulting DLL and `meta.json` into your Jellyfin plugins folder and restart.
